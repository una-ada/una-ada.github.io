## Preface

Welcome back to "Una Makes Fonts for Some Reason," this is probably the [third 
installment][1], which is cool. Today, we're once again aiming to complete the 
styling on [una-ada.github.io][3], particularly regarding `code blocks` and 
their need for a monospace font. I want to try to keep this consistent with Una 
Script stylistically, but with enough distinction that you can tell there's a 
difference. Before I get to that, though, there's some minor technical details 
I want to address regarding Una Script, but after that I'll be making a whole 
new font. This time I might even try to be a bit more thorough in the design 
process... like, actually use the scanner I have access to.[^1]
{:.content__p_dropcap}

[^1]:   In the process of writing out this paragraph, I got distracted by 
        attempting to fix my VS Code settings to add word wrap to Markdown 
        language files. Here's a [useful link][2] about that.

## I. _Technical Updates_ 
{:#i}

### I.1 "Una Script" Metrics
{:#i-1}

Something I've sort of been struggling with for a while now: what is _normal_ 
for an EM square? Like, what's the typical position of the baseline? Currently, 
Una Script has ascent and descent metrics at $500$ and em size at $1000$, which 
means the baseline is at $50%$ of the em square's height! When sitting next to 
other fonts it looks absolutely terrible, and that needs to be fixed before 
moving on to this new font as they should similar metrics so as to mesh as well 
as possible.

I couldn't find anything when searching for references on "typical" sizes here, 
so I've decided to go back to basics. First, returning to the [Design with 
FontForge][4] tutorial's [Font Info & Metadata page][5]. I had high hopes for 
this one, honestly, but it's only a brief coverage of how to edit the metadata 
of your font, which does include overall metrics but not any sort of guidelines 
for them. Similarly, [The EM Square][6] only goes over the various heights and 
a brief reference to the existence of Blue values. A bit more digging brought 
me around to another site, [Font Development Best Practices][7], which has a 
section on metadata that has the [design metrics guideline][8] I'd been looking 
for.

It doesn't give a "use these values for this style of font" or anything like 
that, only recommends comparing to similar (or competing) fonts, which is a 
good strategy here. There is some discussion on the UPM (units-per-em), which 
should be either $1000$ or $2048$, and what supports what best. Of great 
interest here is the section titled "Drawing outside the box" which answers a 
question I've been having while thinking about the metrics: can glyphs extend 
outside the em square so long ascenders and descenders don't mean the rest of 
the glyph is really small? Yes! The article points out that "this is a design 
issue, not a technical one;" there won't be any issues, it's simply an 
indication that the font may be too "large." [This article][9] about glyphs by 
David Turner also answers that question pretty succinctly:
{:.content__p_noindent}

>   _"Note that glyphs can freely extend beyond the EM square if the font 
    designer wants this. The EM is used as a convenience, and is a valuable 
    convenience from traditional typography."_

What I've learned here is that the next step is to find other fonts that might 
have similar metrics to what I'm aiming for and see what those numbers look 
like. Then I resize the glyphs in Una Script, allowing the long descenders to 
pass beyond the descent ruler.
{:.content__p_noindent}

My first thought was that some of Google's fonts (namely [Noto][10] as used 
here) likely have documentation on their metrics. This brought me to a fair bit 
of other documentation on the [googlefonts/gf-docs][11] repo that will be more 
useful in a later section, but not what I'm looking for at the moment. I did 
eventually find the [FONT_CONTRIBUTION][12] file for Noto, which lists the Noto UI  font metrics, which are Roboto Regular's metrics translated to a UPM of $1000$, and also notes Open Sans Regular's metrics:

| OS/2          | Noto UI | Open Sans |
|:--------------|:-------:|:---------:|
| `TypoAscent`  |    1069 |      1056 |
| `TypoDescent` |    -293 |      -271 |
| `TypoLinegap` |       0 |         0 |
| `WinAscent`   |    1069 |      1056 |
| `WinDescent`  |     293 |       271 |

Then I spent several more hours trying to find some other metrics to reference, 
mostly dead ends, but apparently the Liberation font collection's [source][13] 
uses FontForge so the metrics are fairly easy to find by reading the project 
file code:
{:.content__p_noindent}

| OS/2          | Serif | Sans | Mono |
|:--------------|:-----:|:----:|:----:|
| `TypoAscent`  |  1420 | 1491 | 1255 |
| `TypoDescent` |  -442 | -431 | -386 |
| `TypoLinegap` |   307 |  307 |    0 |
| `WinAscent`   |  1825 | 1854 | 1705 |
| `WinDescent`  |   443 |  434 |  615 |

While it's best ignored, the "General" values for ascent and descent in these 
files are all $1638$ and $410$ respectively.
{:.content__p_noindent}

What am I going to be using then? I still have no clue, so I'm going to do some 
testing. I spent a whole night doing this research and I wanted to get this all 
done in a single day, but if running a whole bunch of tests is what it takes to 
do this right then that's what's going to have to happen. I still want someone to guide me here, but the [Glyphs docs][14] just say:

>   _"Different type designers employ different strategies on how to find the 
    best values for the vertical metrics. But beware: amongst font nerds, there 
    are fierce disputes going on about what is the best strategy."_

and that doesn't help me at all! There is some good stuff about setting up the 
values for webfonts. So I'll try to use that methodology throughout my testing. 
I don't want to use the actual descenders as a reference point here, since they 
are so long, so I'm going to start with things like the swash on the "Q," which 
comes off as pretty extreme when you look at the current scaling which round to 
about $(330,\, -120)$ with the UPM at $1000$. On the other hand, the Blue 
values set based on the guidelines I used when initially sizing the letters but 
my cap/ascender height in the range $[360,\, 380]$. I'd say that sticking with 
the values being $(380,\, -120)$ gives a ratio of $3:1$ which is pretty similar 
to that of the previously discussed fonts!
{:.content__p_noindent}

Updating all the glyphs will require a bit more than simply setting new 
metrics, the outlines will also need to be adjusted in both size and position. 
Size is rather easy, it's really just doubled here, but position is difficult 
as apparently not everything transforms correctly. The first error in this was 
me transforming from center rather from the left, so I needed to fix the 
bearings. Easy as that was, I tested the metrics and found that glyphs with 
long descenders were higher up than the rest, and checking the positions of 
those others showed that nothing was on the proper baseline... attempts to 
adjust everything at once didn't seem to work for some reason, so I'm going to 
have to go through them all and make manual adjustments. Fun!

While I'm at it, I figure I'll go through and make the font slightly more 
aligned to the `BlueValues`, do some simplification, and run some other checks 
to clean up the vectors. Again, for the new font and for additional glyphs to 
this one, I really want to figure out how to make sure this is all done before 
the vectors are even imported into FontForge (will discuss this later when 
working on exporting).
{:.content__p_noindent}

When I finally reached the lowercase letters, I did notice a small issue: my 
ascender height is absolutely higher than my cap height! I'm going to have to 
adjust the values here: $(980,\, -120)$. For reference, my current set of 
`BlueValues` is $[-20,30],\,[500,520],\,[720,760],\,[940,980]$. I will need to 
get to adding some values for the descenders and such, these are just baseline, 
x, cap, and ascender. I'm sure I'll do that eventually, but for now I've 
updated the font metrics so [Una Script v2021.05.29][15] is done and I have a 
good idea of the vertical metrics I should be using: $760$ for ascender and cap 
height, $500$ for x-height, $-240$ for descender height (long ascenders and 
descenders are $1000$ and $980$ respectively, with an absolute max-height of 
$1200$).

### I.2 Repository Structure

The other little setup step I wanted to do before I really get started on this 
font has to do with file structures and repositories. Foolishly, I'd previously 
combined my two existing fonts into the same family (Una) and the same repo 
(una-fonts), this is bad! First off, font families are just a collection of 
"subfamilies" or styles, like bold, thin, regular, italic, et cetera. "Una" is 
not a font family but a collection of families (tho each family currently only 
has a "Regular"). This needs to be changed in the metadata, no big deal, just 
keep it in mind going forwards and update them as I get around to it.

The repository thing is really just a choice of how one wants their content 
organized, but keeping them in the same repo is a bit iffy when they're not 
even the same family. So I'm going thru and undoing that whole complicated 
merge thing I did to combine the previously separate repos. But this brings 
about the question of how each of these repos should be structured.

Currently, there's a `/scans` directory which contains the "scans" of the 
original designs, `/src` for the vectors produced from those, `fontForge` which 
just holds the FontForge project file, and finally `/build` for all the 
finished builds (in subdirectories by version). This isn't too far off from 
what the [Google Fonts docs][16] state as the required repo structure:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```
.
├── AUTHORS.txt
├── CONTRIBUTORS.txt
├── OFL.txt
├── README.md
├── documentation
│   ├── DESCRIPTION.en_us.html
│   └── promo.png
├── fonts
│   ├── ttf
│   │   └── FontFamily-Regular.ttf
│   └── variable
│       └── FontFamily-[wdth,wght].ttf
├── sources
│   ├── FontFamily-sources.ext
│   └── build.sh
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore
```

This wouldn't require a huge refactor or anything, just some moving and 
renaming of some files. This is a good thing to decide on here and now when I 
only have a couple repos with a few builds to comb through, and then try to 
keep to the structure for future projects (e.g. this one).
{:.content__p_noindent}

## II. _Design_
{:#ii}

I'm going to keep this one simple, just get the basics down for now at least, 
and only cover [0000 C0 Controls and Basic Latin][17]. Doing something a bit 
different this time and using a [template][18]. Having this printed out makes 
it pretty easy to make sure the glyphs fit into the intended metrics (vertical 
metrics were previously discussed, horizontal were decided to be $420$ units 
wide as a compromise between half the em size and half the ascender height), 
but writing in them is pretty hard to keep looking natural. Some of this can be 
fixed "in post" a bit, but that just means I'm deferring issues to later steps 
already and I was trying to avoid that this time (like with the template thing)!
{:.content__p_dropcap}

As for the concept of the design, I'm trying to maintain a consistent style 
with Una Script (my handwriting) while also adopting a few adjustments to make 
the letters fit more into the intended width. This doesn't really show all that 
much beyond adding crossbars and serifs here and there, since I really just 
want it to be a metrically consistent alternative version... oh, there is the 
thing with how all the descenders are different, that one's pretty obvious 
since the ones on Una Script are pretty long, lol.
{:.content__p_noindent}

## III. _Digitization_
{:#iii}

Continuing on with attempts to do things more "properly," this time I'm going 
to actually use a scanner instead of just taking a picture. This should help 
with keeping the metrics all consistent... though, given that the template has 
guidelines for them, it wouldn't be *too* absurd to correct them later, but 
again that would be deferring issues until later when they can be avoided now. 
Only saying this because of some technical issues with getting scanners to 
work, but managed to resolve that and now have [the scan][19].
{:.content__p_dropcap}

I did put in all this effort just to write out new glyphs, I realized along the 
way that I could just copy the vectors of Una Script and adjust them to the 
intended metrics for this new font... this is for stylistic consistency and not 
because I'm already tired of working on this. Other than that this follows the 
typical Una formula for tracing with vectors in Illustrator: draw points 
with the pen tool (P), curve the lines with the anchor point tool (&#8679;C),  
direct selection tool (A) to fix up any curve lines and anchor points, 
rinse, repeat, on and on... it's a very repetitive process. [But I got through 
it eventually][20]!

Then these vectors need to be cleaned up, which doesn't require too much 
creativity or guessing this time around on account of the consistent metrics. I 
set up a new Illustrator document as 1000 x 1000 and put guidelines down for 
the baseline and x-height, calculated the amount I would have to scale the 
vectors up by dividing my UPM by the height of the scanned templates, and 
guessed the stroke width I could get away with here ($110$ which is less than 
the $180$ Una Script is now after the $200%$ upscale, but that's fine). With 
all those initial steps out of the way, the rest is just moving each glyph to 
fit in the guides, I added some new guides $55$ (half the stroke) away from the 
ascender and descender lines, as well as from my horizontal metric guidelines, 
so I could just fit the objects to these and the stroked paths would fit within 
the intended guides.
{:.content___p_noindent}

>   **Cool Illustrator Trick 1:** Rather than using a transform on the whole 
    layer of glyphs and making the layer fucking massive, I can use `Object > 
    Transform > Transform Each` to resize each path or group without changing 
    their position and thus keeping them more or less in reach for later 
    editing! 

>   **Cool Illustrator Trick 2:** These glyphs are all currently either simple 
    paths or groups in the same layer, but later I will want to export them all 
    using a script that exports separate layers.[^4] This means moving each and
    every one of them into its own layer, which can be a real drag. Since I 
    already have all the layers I want the objects to be in, I can select the
    object in the editor, select the layer for it in Layers, then use `Object > 
    Arrange > Send to Current Layer`.

[^4]:   Note about my methodology with this, I decided back when working on Una 
        Script that the exported vectors should all be named as their Unicode 
        character name in camel case. This makes it easier to find them later 
        when importing into FontForge.

This isn't exactly normal for a monospace font, but along the way I decided 
that some glyphs, particularly capitals and similarly sized glyphs, would 
actually have their _strokes_ meet the _path_ guideline for the ascender. 
Essentially, making my cap height $55$ less than my ascender height. This 
reduces the amount of distortion on those glyphs a little and makes them look 
closer to the original Una Script ones without messing with the scale of the 
font too much. I didn't set guidelines for the paths relative to the baseline, 
even tho the baseline should be the guideline for the strokes, because I wanted 
to be able to make some optical sizing decisions without struggling to 
circumvent the guideline snapping which is otherwise extremely useful.[^3]
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^3]:   It was at this point that I once again started caring about how VS Code 
        works. Specifically, I ended up having to correct a lot of typos, so I 
        wanted some sort of spellchecker. Looking for one in the marketplace, I 
        came across [Code Spell Checker][23] by [Street Side Software][24] 
        which not only will do spellchecking for articles like this one, but 
        also can handle `camelCase` words in code! Big fan!

>   **Cool Illustrator Trick 3:** If you transform an object with something 
    like a rotation, the bounding box will no longer be orthogonal to the grid, 
    which is inconvenient for sizing relative to guidelines! There is a tool to
    fix this which you can access with `Object > Transform > Reset Bounding 
    Box`.

After another grind through all 94[^2] glyphs, [I managed to survive this step 
as well][21]. It is Monday already and I wanted this whole font done Saturday, 
so I'm not exactly happy with my progress!
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^2]:   But there's 95 characters in [U0000][17]! Well, one of those is the 
        space, which doesn't have any vectors and will be constructed entirely 
        out of bearings in FontForge.

That's most of the design-oriented steps of the digitization done! Now I'm 
moving on to more technical parts. These glyphs are all paths at the moment, 
which theoretically could be imported into FontForge as is, then use the 
[Expand Stroke facility][22] in there. I'm considering switching my workflow 
over to this as it would allow for variations in font weight, theoretically, 
but that is an experiment for a later time. For now, I'm sticking to doing the 
expansions within Illustrator because I adjusted these glyphs based on the 
strokes they have now, removing the strokes and adding them back in later could 
lead to some deviations and errors. That said, I just need to unlock and unhide 
all my layers and apply `Object > Expand...` to every object.

>   **Cool Illustrator Trick 4:** Clicking on the visibility toggle and 
    dragging down a long list of layers is annoying at best. If you just want 
    to hide all layers except for one, then hold Alt/&#2325; when clicking on 
    the toggle for the layer you want to work on and it will hide all the 
    others!

Expanding does most of the work, but it does (sometimes) keep the original 
stroke and overlapping strokes will just be overlapping outlines now, so I need 
to do another pass through using the `Unite` function in the `Pathfinder`. I 
would love to just apply this to all layers at once, but having multiple glyphs 
selected when running this function would just unite them all into one object! 
{:.content__p_noindent}

>   **Cool Illustrator Trick 5:** Is expanding your strokes not working? Are 
    your nice, rounded caps defaulting to boring flat ends? Then you need 
    `Object > Flatten Transparency`! This fun little function is _significantly 
    worse_ than expanding and will need to be cleaned up with a bit of `Shape 
    Builder Tool` (&#8679;M) and `Object > Path > Simplify`, but it'll still do 
    the job!

Since this is completely routine, with the steps the exact same for each layer 
(toggle visibility, select all, unite, toggle visibility, repeat...) I would 
really like to just automate it, but I do not know how! Wll, since I'm probably 
going to be doing this a lot in the future, might as well put the effort in now.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Ok, detour time, automating this annoying thing. First off, this doesn't seem 
possible to be done with actions, so it's going to have to be a [script][25]. 
Also, this doesn't seem super uncommon a thing to do, so there's probably 
already one made for it. I found [some blog post][26] in my initial search, 
which seems to be just someone saving a reply from the [Adobe Support 
Community][27], and it doesn't work. [Looking into why it doesn't][28] made it 
obvious that this weird single-line snippet was all lowercase? So I searched 
for the [original thread][29] and found not only the [properly formatted 
reply][31], but [another more complete script][32] by the user [zertle][30]:

```javascript
function MergeAllLayers() {
  // exit early if there are no files open
  if (!app.documents.length) return;
  var doc = app.activeDocument;
  // clear selection
  doc.selection = null;
  // loop through all layers
  var layers = doc.layers;
  for (var i = 0, ii = layers.length; i < ii; i++) {
    // select everything on the current layer
    layers.hasSelectedArtwork = true;
    app.executeMenuCommand("group");
    app.executeMenuCommand("Live Pathfinder Add");
    app.executeMenuCommand("expandStyle");
    // clear selection
    doc.selection = null;
  }
}
MergeAllLayers();
```

... and ... it didn't work! Let's figure out why. First, strip this all down to 
just what's inside the loop, replace variables with their definitions, and try 
that. Nothing. Line by line then, does the selection trick work? No. According 
to [an answer to a similar problem][33], what actually needs to run is:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
app.activeDocument.activeLayer.hasSelectedArtwork = true;
```

So, how do I change the active layer when looping? Or can I just select each 
layer from an array while looping? Reading into a [thread on a similar 
topic][34] implies that's what I should do:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
  for(var i = 0; i < layers.length; i++){
    // select everything on the current layer
    var layer = layers[i];
    layer.hasSelectedArtwork = true;
    // ...
  }
```

I'd also like to throw the expansion step into this script so I can avoid doing 
that one manually in the future as well (even though it's trivial), but there's 
a dialog for it so it would actually be worse to do it that way. There is a 
[way to circumvent this][35], but it requires setting options for Actions, so 
it isn't all handled in the script (I want to avoid doing that). Anyway, for 
safety, I'll also throw in a little guard for locked layers:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
    if(layer.locked) continue;
```

Now [the script][36] is all working! This will be excellent for future work, 
even though in this instance it probably took up more time to write and debug. 
😅
{:.content__p_noindent}

Now back to same old same old: using [Tom Byrne][37]'s [MultiExporter.jsx][38] 
to export all these layers as SVGs. When running this script, remember to 
_deselect the "Trim Edges" option._ I foolishly forgot to do this the first 
time around and it cuts all the exported SVGs down to just the size of the 
glyphs themselves rather than the whole em square![^5] For organization, I'm 
creating a new directory, `/sources/vectors` in the repo, and putting 
everything here in a subdirectory for the Unicode block in case I want to 
expand the coverage of this font later on: `/sources/vectors/0000`.

[^5]:   Not only can this be a huge pain in the ass when it comes time to 
        import the vectors to FontForge, it also slows the script way down as 
        it has to determine the trim sizes for nearly a hundred layers _and_ it 
        tends to stop if you click away from the window unlike when it's 
        deselected.

That's it for this section, I now have [a folder][39] containing all my 
vectorized glyphs, individually, properly positioned. 🎉
{:.content__p_noindent}

## IV. _Font_
{:#iv}

Finally, I get to open up [FontForge][40]. Yay! I don't need to do anything to 
the settings on encoding opening the font, I'm only doing the ASCII characters 
here, so there isn't really any need to change the character set from the 
default. [Importing][41] is straightforward with hotkeys: &#8984;&#8679;I on 
each glyph. Selection for imports is pretty easy, since all the files are named 
after the glyph name, I really wish I could automate this, though. I swear I'm 
not going to detour for that this time.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

It isn't super important for the end product to set the ascent and descent 
values, but I need to do it so that the imports are properly positioned with a 
baseline at zero (and also so the previews look better). As previously 
mentioned, these values are $760$ and $240$ respectively.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Now that all the vectors [are imported][42], it's time for some cleanup! Just 
going to run `Element > Validate` to get a quick rundown of what might need to 
be fixed before probably just running through the motions I'm already used
to...  okay, so it kind of crashed when I did that. It's to be expected that 
there would be some weird issues, this is my first time running this on a Mac. 
So let's just do the basics then:

 -  `Element > Add Extrema` (&#8984;&#8679;X)<br/>
    Add control points to the extrema of curves.
 -  `Element > Round > To Int` (&#8984;&#8679;_)<br/>
    Make sure all the control points are at integer values.
 -  `Element > Correct Direction` (&#8984;&#8679;D)<br/>
    Correct the path direction on the glyphs, this should have been handled by 
    the importer, but it's always good to play it safe.

Then I'll run a manual `Element > Validate > Find Problems`, and see what it 
comes up with. Which seems to be some "the paths that make up this glyph 
intersect one another," and I need to remember how to fix that. [A comment][43] 
on GitHub recommends `Element > Overlap > Remove Overlap` (&#8984;&#8679;O), 
which seems to work.
{:.content__p_noindent.}

I'm also getting a lot more missing extrema errors than I'd expect, and 
checking the glyphs doesn't really show any obvious problems. According to [a 
thread][44] I found about this, it's okay to ignore these in instances like 
this, or just in general apparently.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Calling it good for the vector issues at [this point][45]. Onto metrics! 
Luckily, since this is a monospace font, I don't have to bother with kerning 
this time! I do still need to do a little bit of horizontal metrics, 
specifically with bearings and thus width. I've decided to keep similar to Una 
Script spacing where the default bearings are $20$, so all glyphs should be 
$460$ units wide, even the ones that do not take up the entire $420$ width. 
Applying this is a simple `Metrics > Set Width` (&#8984;&#8679;L) then
`Metrics > Center in Width`, and that's my horizontal metrics done!

Vertical metrics is where I actually have to start trying 😭. Starting with the 
basics, none of these should go past the em square so my `typo`, `hhea`, and 
`win` values should be the same as my ascent and descent. Easy. My capital 
height is $55$ less than the ascent (see previous section): $705$, and my 
x-height is $500$. The Glyphs docs page on [vertical metrics][14] had those 
strategies for calculating the line gaps, which for this instance would either 
be $0$ per the Adobe and Microsoft strategies or in the range of $[100, 200]$ 
per the Webfont strategy (the default in the dialog was $90$, for reference). 
I'll be going with the Webfont strategy on this one, specifically choosing just 
$100$. Which [wraps up][46] the basic vertical metrics.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Then there's the `BlueValues` and `BlueScale` properties in the PS Private 
table... the automated guess for these was $[-15,2],\,[498,504],\,[703,707],\,
[760,760]$ which is about my baseline, x, cap, and ascender. The last one isn't 
really necessary because it has a height of zero (all my ascenders were put 
directly on the line), but this seems to otherwise cover everything.[^6] My "n" 
was a bit outside it, but I'd rather just move the control points since they 
were weird anyway. The scale is probably fine by default, but I'll run a 
validation check just in case anyway[^7]... well, that's [done then][47].
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^6]:   This was more complicated in previous fonts because they weren't 
        designed to be as metrically consistent, whereas the glyphs in this 
        instance were meant to stay around the guidelines.

[^7]:   It crashed again! Last time I ran the validation check it didn't, so I 
        was hoping I could get away with it again. Whatever, I'd probably just 
        ignore the errors at this point anyway, lol.

All that's left here is to set the rest of the metadata: the `PS Names` table. 
Sticking to a better format for this stuff this time, the `Family Name` is "Una 
Mono," the `Fontname` then is `UnaMono-Regular`, but still naming the versions 
by the date (`2021.05.31`). [Now][48] there's only _one more_ step for this 
section!

Time to export the font with `File > Generate Fonts...` (&#8984;&#8679;G)! From 
here on, I will only be generating the TrueType (.ttf) files in FontForge, to 
keep with the simplest repo structure. I'm selecting both "Apple" and 
"OpenType" formats in the options, since that seems to be the best way to do 
it, and just leaving everything else as default. This gets exported[^8] into a 
new directory, `/old/[version]`, and then copied to the `/font` directory. Et 
voila, [font done][49]! 🔥

[^8]:   Validation ran just fine on the exporter. Confusingly, a few new issues 
        popped up: new non-integer values and a self-intersecting glyph. Those 
        were pretty easy fixes, but still weird to see at this point.

## V. _Tests_
{:#v}

Theoretically, this font works just fine, I did check the metrics in FontForge after all. However, how does it feel in context? How does it look in the "real world?" Time to find out! First, this was meant for code, so here's some typical sort of code:
{:.content__p_dropcap}

![Single line code test][50]
{:.content__p_noindent .__light}

![Single line code test][51]
{:.content__p_noindent .__dark}

So far, this looks fine, not a huge fan of how the `=` and `>` align, but I can 
live with it until I decide something bigger needs to be changed. But code is 
usually multiple lines, and the point of monospace fonts is to be consistently 
wide so characters line up, how does that look? Here:
{:.content__p_noindent}

![Multiple line code test][52]
{:.content__p_noindent .__light}

![Multiple line code test][53]
{:.content__p_noindent .__dark}

Okay, so it looks alright on its own, how about next to another font? 
Specifically, how does it look with Una Script?

![Pairing test with Una Script][54]
{:.content__p_noindent .__light}

![Pairing test with Una Script][55]
{:.content__p_noindent .__dark}

First thing to note here: the sizes are similar enough to not really complain 
about! This would have been a huge problem if not for the work I did in 
[Section I](#i), so hooray for that. Other than that, the weight has a huge 
contrast, and this was noted when I was discussing the stroke widths in 
[Section III](#iii); heavier would not work at all with the font, so if I want 
them to be the same weight, that will be something to work on for Una Script.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Again, the issues here are mostly Script's fault, not this font, but there is 
also the x-height inconsistency to note. It looks like Script has much taller 
lowercase letters here, because they tend to be higher up while also being very 
inconsistent between glyphs. I don't know if I want to go through and change 
this, but it's a big consideration with respect to future work on that font.
{:.content__p_noindent}

What if we use Una Mono alongside another font like [Noto Sans][56]? Then we 
see a better consistency in size, but there is still a slight difference in 
weight between "Regular" fonts:
{:.content__p_noindent}

![Pairing test with Noto Sans Regular][57]
{:.content__p_noindent .__light}

![Pairing test with Noto Sans Regular][58]
{:.content__p_noindent .__dark}

However, in this case we can reduce that contrast significantly by choosing a 
different weight for Noto Sans, such as SemiBold:
{:.content__p_noindent}

![Pairing test with Noto Sans SemiBold][59]
{:.content__p_noindent .__light}

![Pairing test with Noto Sans SemiBold][60]
{:.content__p_noindent .__dark}

It's safe to say, from these tests, that Una Mono Regular is actually more of a 
SemiBold weight; though, as far as I know, there is no standard for what each 
font weight looks like. I may consider for future work, on both Una Mono and 
Script, adding variable weights, and aiming to create more consistent styling 
across them in that regard.
{:.content__p_noindent}

That was everything I wanted to test, at least with the design itself, I'll 
save the work of using it as a web font on [una-ada.github.io][3] for a later 
time.[^9] Cheers all around, patting myself on the back, go me! See you next 
time on "Una Makes Fonts for Some Reason" when I'll "probably" continue to try 
to make better things in better ways (I'll at least try)!

[^9]:   Probably later tonight, if I'm being honest.
