## IX. _Player Inputs_
{:#ix}

I'm in the final stretch now, at least as far as project requirements go. It's 
time to work on the game loop! Going to start with being able to create new 
Celestial instances on a user input. To make sure the player can adjust the 
moon before it's animated, I need to add in some conditionals on the physics 
methods (also throwing in some spice for upcoming sections):
{:.content__p_dropcap}

```javascript
// In Celestial.js
class Celestial {
  /** ...
   * @arg {boolean} [options.physical=false] Can the object be manipulated?
   * ...
   */
  constructor(options) {
    // ...
    /** @var {boolean} physical Can the object be manipulated? */
    this.physical = options.physical || false;
    // ...

// In Physics#updateVelocities and Physics#updatePositions
  (obj) =>
    obj instanceof Celestial &&
    obj.physical &&
    // ...
```

This is only on the velocity and position updates, I want to be able to check 
collisions with objects that aren't `Celestial`s. Honestly the rest of this is 
going to be really boring, it's basically one-for-one writing out what's in the 
pseudocode for the game loop regarding mouse events and, in turn, recreating 
what's in the original code for the old project with adaptations to the new 
structure. Technically, I did it all in a single line... oops:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
// Handle player input
mouse.isDown
  ? model.isCreating
    ? mouse.change.magnitude > 18
      // Set velocity if mouse outside threshold
      ? (model.newborn.velocity = mouse.change
          .copy()
          .scale(Game.SCALE.velocity)
          .reflectHorizontal()
          .reflectVertical())
      // Customize mass if mouse still in threshold
      : model.customMassAllowed &&
        (model.newborn.mass *= Game.SCALE.mass)
    // Create new Celestial on mouse down
    : model.health > 0 &&
      (model.isCreating = true) &&
      (model.newborn = new Celestial({
        mass: 1.35e23,
        position: this.view.origin
          .copy()
          .subtract(mouse.position)
          .subtract(this.view.offset)
          .scale(0 - this.view.scale),
        size: 0.54e8,
      })) &&
      model.scene.push(model.newborn)
  // Release newborn Celestial on mouse up
  : model.isCreating &&
    (model.newborn.physical = true) &&
    (model.health -= 1) &&
    (model.isCreating = false);
```

It was at [this point][1] that I realized I _really, really_ need to just get 
this  done, so everything from here one was pretty much thrown together in a 
frenzy and is far from what I want it to be. The rest of this blog entry will 
just be covering what I _did_[^1] to meet the requirements of the assignment in 
a single night; I will probably continue to work on this project in the future 
to make it look more like what I want it to be.

[^1]:	I mean to say that I'm writing this in retrospect, I didn't have time 
		to write it out while I was working/panicking.

## X. _Areas_
{:#x}

While a Celestial is a game object in the scene that acts as a physical object, 
there are other objects that will need to exist in the scene to define certain 
aspects in game play. Namely, I needed to be able to define some "Area" in the 
scene, or view in general, that could be used generally to handle game 
mechanics such as restricting the user input zone and setting win conditions if 
the player achieves the desired goal. To that end, I [wrote][2] a simple class 
to define an `Area`:
{:.content__p_dropcap}

```javascript
class Area {
  /**
   * Create a new scene area game object.
   * @arg {Point} position Position coordinates in meters.
   * @arg {Point} size Size in meters.
   * @arg {Object} options Optional parameters.
   * @arg {string} [options.name="Unnamed Area"] Display name.
   * @arg {string} [options.texture] The path of a texture for rendering.
   */
  constructor(position, size, options){
    this.name = options.name || "Unnamed Area";
    this.birth = +new Date();
    this.position = position;
    this.size = size;
    this.hitBox = "RECTANGLE";
    this.collisions = [];
    this.texture = options.texture || null;
  }
} 
```

### X-1. Rendering
{:#x-1}

Note that `Area#size` is a `Point` rather than a `number` as in a `Celestial#`, 
because it is a rectangle defined by two points: $P_1$, the top-left corner 
(`Area#position`), and $P_2$, the bottom-right corner relative to $P_1$ 
(`Area#size`). Since this is quite different from `Celestial` instance styling, 
I also needed to add in some handling for the different `GameData#scene` 
element types in the `Renderer`s like so:

```javascript
// In Renderer.js
class Renderer {
  // ...
  getPosition(obj) {
    const origin = this.origin,
      position = obj.position.copy().scale(1 / this.scale),
      offset = obj instanceof Celestial ? obj.size / (this.scale * 2) : 0;
    return origin.add(position).subtract(offset);
  }
  // ...

// In DOMRenderer.js
class DOMRenderer extends Renderer {
  // ...
  render() {
    const scene = this.model.scene;
    scene.forEach(
      (obj) => {
        const elem = obj.element || this.generateElement(obj),
          style = elem.style,
          position = this.getPosition(obj);
        [style.left, style.top, style.width, style.height] =
          obj instanceof Celestial
            ? [
                `${position.x}px`,
                `${position.y}px`,
                `${obj.size / this.scale}px`,
                `${obj.size / this.scale}px`,
              ]
            : [
                `${position.x}px`,
                `${position.y}px`,
                `${obj.size.x / this.scale}px`,
                `${obj.size.y / this.scale}px`,
              ];
			    // ...
  generateElement(obj) {
    const type = obj instanceof Celestial ? "celestial" : "viewarea",
      element = document.createElement(type),
      cleanName = obj.name.replace(/\s+/g, "-").toLowerCase();
    element.classList.add(`gravity__${type}_${cleanName}`);
    // ...
```

### X-2. Physics
{:#x-2}

I also needed to add collision detection for something that isn't a circle... 
this is where I got really lazy. I decided that, fuck it, I don't need to check 
for actual collisions in this instance, I just need to check that the center of 
the circle is somewhere in a rectangular area that is orthogonal to the axes. 
Essentially, I made it trivial by making assumptions, this is not a generalized 
method in the slightest:[^2]

[^2]:   I'm actually not sure at this point how useful a more generalized 
        method for detecting intersections between a rectangle and a circle 
        would even be. Theoretically, I could say as long as the `Celestial` 
        _touches_ the `Area` defined as the target then the player wins the 
        level, but using centers works just fine and doesn't really contradict 
        any intuitive understanding of how something like this would function.

```javascript
static circleInRectangle(a, b) {
  let p1 = a.position.copy(),
    p2 = p1.copy().add(a.size),
    c = b.position.copy();
  return c.x > p1.x && c.x < p2.x && c.y > p1.y && c.y < p2.y;
}
```

But, hey, it works for what I need it to do. Of course this was then references 
as `Physics.INTERSECT__CHECKS.RECTANGLE.CIRCLE` and a quick function to reverse 
the order of the arguments before calling it was used as `...CIRCLE.RECTANGLE`. 
Easy. Though there was some extra debugging at this point to make sure that the 
physics would work even if there were objects in the scene that it wasn't 
supposed to be considering, a simple matter of returning the accumulator 
without manipulation in `Array.reduce()`.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Then I realized that this function would be necessary for checking if the 
user's mouse is in an area, so I [generalized it a bit][3] in the opposite 
direction: `pointInRectangle` and updated the type of the arguments:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```JavaScript
/**
 * @arg {Point} point
 * @arg {Area} rect
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
static pointInRectangle(point, rect) {
  let p1 = rect.position.copy(),
    p2 = p1.copy().add(rect.size);
  return point.x > p1.x && point.x < p2.x && point.y > p1.y && point.y < p2.y;
}
```

## XI. _Interface_
{:#xi}

Once again, this was just [implementing the bare minimum][4]: the game message, 
the "lives" counter, and a link back to the source code, all simply added into 
index.html:
{:.content__p_dropcap}

```markup
  <div id="lives">x attempts remaining</div>
  <div id="message">loading...</div>
  <div id="repo">
    <a href="https://github.com/una-ada/gravity">source code</a>
  </div>
```

I did attempt to throw in a little bit of personality by using [Una Script][5] 
as the typeface for all this.[^3] Styling wasn't really worth mentioning beyond 
that, just text size and `position: absolute` essentially.
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^3]:   I also [quickly added][7] in some actual use of the `Celestial#texture` 
        property, if only to somewhat mirror the style of the original page.

Out of desperation, reference to these elements was [written][6] in the 
`GameData` module rather than `DOMRenderer`, thus why I wrote the tags out in 
the first place. Anyway, they were just cached in the constructor:

```javascript
/** @var {HTMLElement} healthDisplay Remaining attempts display element. */
this.healthDisplay = document.querySelector("div#health");
/** @var {HTMLElement} message Element displaying game message. */
this.message = document.querySelector("div#message");
```

and then the health display was updated with a simple template string, since 
`GameData#health` is already handled:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
model.healthDisplay.textContent = `${Math.max(
  0,
  model.health
)} lives remaining.`;
```

Though do note here that use of `Math.max()`; for some reason the 
`GameData#health` value ended up being `-1` when all the attempts were used up, 
which was not ideal but I didn't have time to go through and debug that in the 
game loop, 🙇🏻‍♀️.
{:.content__p_noindent}

The message display was [handled][8] similarly with a simple update of the 
cached element's `innerHTML` using a new property called `GameData#condition`. 
This is also a shortcut, since in the future I'd like the game messages to be 
defined per level instead of in general like this. Doing it that way would've 
also continued along my hope to eventually add in different types of levels, 
but anyway, this all looks something like this:

```javascript
// In GameData.js
class GameData {
  constructor() {
    // ...
    /** @var {string} condition Current game condition. */
    this.condition = "PLAY";
    // ...

// In DOMRenderer.js
class DOMRenderer extends Renderer {
  // ...
  render() {
    // ...
    model.message.innerHTML =
      model.condition === "PLAY"
        ? `Shoot the moon from the
          <span class="red">red</span> area into the
          <span class="blue">blue</span> area.`
        : model.condition === "WIN"
          ? `You win! Congratulations!`
              : `<span class="red">You lost! Oh no!</span>`;
    // ...
```

## XII. _Condition Checks_
{:#xii}

From there, I just needed to throw together some methods to check for certain 
win or loss conditions. I figured, given that it would be a bit of a detour and 
not absolutely necessary at this stage to add a a collision handler that would 
destroy the smaller `Celestial#` after two hit each other, the only loss 
condition that absolutely needed to be implemented for this to function as 
"minimum viable product" would be a time-based one.[^4]
{:.content__p_dropcap}

[^4]:   This is primarily to not just skip out on handling more collisions, but 
        also for objects that have flown far off screen or are in a somewhat 
        stable orbit. In the future, the lattermost of these instances will be 
        the only reason such a condition would need to exist. Though, in 
        theory, there are alternative ways to handle that as well, probably.

To make this easier, I first [threw][9] some getters into `GameData` for the 
`Area`s that would be game mechanic relevant. This is another instance of not 
very scalable methods being added in to make everything work right away:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
/** @var {Area} target The level target area. */
get target() {
  return this.scene.find(
    (obj) => obj instanceof Area && obj.name.toLowercase() === "target"
  );
}
/** @var {Area} playArea The level play area. */
get playArea() {
  return this.scene.find(
    (obj) => obj instanceof Area && obj.name.toLowerCase() === "play area"
  );
}
```

These are pretty simple methods that just use `Array.find()` to search the 
`GameData#scene` for the properly named `Area`s. You could see how this would 
not work for any sort of deviation in level design from the current setup, but 
it's what works for the moment![^5]
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^5]:   Not entirely worth mentioning in the main narrative here, but this is 
        also terribly handled in the renderer. Since there is absolutely no 
        `Area#texture` implementation, the only way to distinguish between the 
        `target` and the `play area` was to have `DOMRenderer` style them based 
        on their names:

    ```javascript
    obj instanceof Area &&
      (obj.name.toLowerCase() === "target"
        ? (element.style.backgroundColor = `rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.7)`)
        : obj.name.toLowerCase() === "play" &&
          (element.style.backgroundColor = `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.7)`));
    ```

Restricting the player to only creating a new `Celestial` within the "play 
area" then was pretty easy to [implement][10]. Just add an extra condition that 
the mouse position is within the correct area to the player input handling in 
`Game#loop`:

```javascript
let scaledClick;
model.condition === "PLAY" &&
  (mouse.isDown
    ? model.isCreating
      ? mouse.change.magnitude > 18
        // ...
      : // Create new Celestial on mouse down
        model.health > 0 &&
        Physics.pointInRectangle(
          (scaledClick = this.view.origin
            .copy()
            .subtract(mouse.position)
            .subtract(this.view.offset)
            .scale(0 - this.view.scale)),
          model.playArea
        ) &&
        // ...
```

This is saved into the variable `scaledClick` because it is checking the same 
`Point` that would be used to determine the `Celestial#position`, so saving it 
here means not repeating all of that later. 
{:.content__p_noindent}

Finally, I actually added in the condition checks! The loss condition was 
already discussed, as far as why it is the way it is, but the [way it was 
implemented][11] is somewhat interesting, I suppose. Rather than using 
something boring like `setTimeout`, I used a comparison of the 
`Celestial#birth` timestamp with a `+new Date()` timestamp in the game loop, 
with a hardcoded 30 second (`30e3`ms) difference:

```javascript
// Loss conditions
model.condition === "PLAY" &&
  model.health <= 0 &&
  new Date() - 30e3 >
    model.scene.slice().reverse()
      .find(
        (obj) =>
          obj instanceof Celestial && obj.name.toLowerCase() === "played"
      ).birth &&
  (model.condition = "LOSS");
```

This is only used when the `health` value is at or lower than `0`, so the 
player has used up all attempts, and reverses a copy (`.slice()`) of the 
`Model#scene` array to find the last `Celestial#` created by the player. 
{:.content__p_noindent}

The win condition might look somewhat more complicated, but it really isn't. 
All [I did][12] was use an `Array.reduce()` on the `Model#scene` array to 
essentially implement the `||` operator over the results of checking if any of 
the "played" `Celestial` instances have collided with the "target" `Area#`:[^6]
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^6]:   I'm making a point of listing these object so literally because the 
        code itself does checks to make sure the "'played' `Celestial`" is both 
        an instance of `Celestial` and has the name `"played"`. Similarly that 
        the "'target' `Area#`" is an `Area#` and has the name `"target"`.

```javascript
// Win conditions
model.condition === "PLAY" &&
  model.scene.reduce(
    (acc, obj) =>
      // Check played Celestial
      obj instanceof Celestial && obj.name === "played"
        ? obj.collisions.find(
            (hit) =>
              // Check if hit target
              hit.who instanceof Area &&
              hit.who.name.toLowerCase() === "target"
          ) || acc
        : acc,
    false
  ) &&
  (model.condition = "WIN");
```

With those two, annoyingly simplified, conditions in place, this could then be 
called a "game." Thus, this project was complete enough to present in my 
course, with some [fixing up of the README][13] something like 15 minutes 
before presentations began, aha. Not that I'm happy with it in this state at 
all! I'm almost definitely going to come back later to add in some more 
graphics, info displays for mass and velocity, and hopefully level loading as 
well! Regardless, that's all for now!
