## VI. _Math_
{:#vi}

I mentioned in a [previous section][4] that the way I was saving positions 
(simply saving the values as properties in an Object, see below) may be better 
than the very rudimentary implementation with Arrays but it's still quite 
unsatisfactory. So I'm going to work on that _a bit_!
{:.content__p_dropcap}

```javascript
position: {
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
},
```

This is terrible because I'm going to be doing a lot of math in the physics 
engine, so having to access things like this is pretty annoying. What I need is 
some sort of utility module that will contain a `Point` class as well as a 
`Vector` class that extends it, at least:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
/** @module Utils - A collection of utility classes. */
export class Point { /* ... */ }
export class Vector extends Point { /* ... */ }
```

How is a vector a subclass of a point? You might ask. Simple, where a point is 
defined by an array of positions of length $n$ in $n$-dimensional space, a 
vector is defined by an array of lengths of length $n$. The primary difference 
is that we can do much more with a these values in a vector, such as finding 
their magnitude, that we wouldn't do with points.
{:.content__p_noindent}

### VI-1. Theory
{:#vi-1}

Basically, with vectors we have these "lengths" which we can call components, 
but at some point we're going to want the magnitude and direction. This is 
fundamentally equivalent to [converting][1] a point at the coordinates set by 
the components into polar coordinates from Cartesian coordinates. If we define 
this vector, let's call it $\vec{a}$, by its components, we'd have

$$ \vec{a} = a_x\hat{\imath} + a_y\hat{\jmath}, \tag1 $$

which we can then get the magnitude, $r$, from with the formula
{:.content__p_noindent}

$$ a = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2}. \tag2 $$

Getting the direction, $\phi$, is a bit more complicated, because angles are 
just weird when working with different quadrants of the Cartesian plane:
{:.content__p_noindent}

$$
  \phi = \begin{cases}
    \arctan{\left(\frac{a_y}{a_x} \right)}, & \text{if $a_x\gt0$} \\
    \arctan{\left(\frac{a_y}{a_x} \right)} + \pi,
      & \text{if $a_x\lt0$ and $a_y\ge0$} \\
    \arctan{\left(\frac{a_y}{a_x} \right)} - \pi,
      & \text{if $a_x\lt0$ and $a_y\lt0$} \\
    \frac{\pi}2, & \text{if $a_x=0$ and $a_y\gt0$} \\
    -\frac{\pi}2, & \text{if $a_x=0$ and $a_y\lt0$} \\
    \text{undefined}, & \text{if $a_x=0$ and $a_y=0$}
  \end{cases} \tag3
$$

Though, apparently, there's a simpler way to do this using $r$. Despite my 
decent handle on trigonometry, I hadn't considered this in the previous version 
of this project, but it seems like a good strategy:
{:.content__p_noindent}

$$
  \phi = \begin{cases}
    \arccos{\left(\frac{a_x}r \right)}, & \text{if $a_y\ge0$ and $r\neq0$} \\
    -\arccos{\left(\frac{a_x}r \right)}, & \text{if $a_y\lt0$} \\
    \text{undefined}, & \text{if $r=0$.}
  \end{cases} \tag4
$$

The reverse is rather trivial in comparison, since it's the sort of thing 
trigonometric functions are designed to do:

$$
  \begin{align}
    a_x &= r\cos{\phi}, \tag{5a} \\
    a_y &= r\sin{\phi}. \tag{5b} \\
  \end{align}
$$

Because this is so much simpler, I'll implement this first before dealing with 
the piecewise function stuff.
{:.content__p_noindent}

### VI-2. Implementation
{:#vi-2}

There is something I'd like to test out with this: using setters and getters. 
Rather than having functions like `Vector#getMagnitude` and 
`Vector#setMagnitude`, I'll just have `Vector#magnitude` defined by a getter 
and a setter:

```javascript
/** @type {number} */
get magnitude() {
  return Math.sqrt(this.x ** 2 + this.y ** 2);
}
set magnitude(magnitude) {
  let direction = this.direction;
  this.x = magnitude * Math.cos(direction);
  this.y = magnitude * Math.sin(direction);
}
```

Setting the lengths along the axes is dependent on both magnitude and 
direction, so to set either of them I first need to cache the other one. Which 
is basically all there is to it. On the other hand, I would like to keep angles 
within a single rotation for consistency, so setting `direction` needs an extra 
little bit of fixing up just in case:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
set direction(direction) {
  let magnitude = this.magnitude;
  // Keep direction within [-pi, pi]
  if(Math.abs(direction) > Math.PI) direction %= Math.PI;
  this.x = magnitude * Math.cos(direction);
  this.y = magnitude * Math.sin(direction);
}
```

I'm ignoring this for now, but I'm pretty sure these angles would not properly 
translate into CSS properties. I mean, sure, I can just set the angle in radian 
units, but that's not the problem. The $y$-coordinates in CSS are all reflected 
over the $x$-axis because they are measured from the top rather than the 
bottom. I'll need to get more testing done before I can determine a) if this is 
a real issue and b) if it should be addressed in the utility functions or in 
the rendering functions. I'm going to sleep now, so I'll just [push][2] what 
I've gotten done so far here.

Good morning! I still haven't written a getter for direction, which is really 
important! So here we go:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
get direction() {
  let magnitude = this.magnitude;
  if(magnitude = 0) return NaN;
  return (this.y < 0 ? -1 : 1) * Math.acos(Math.PI / magnitude);
}
```

I cut a lot of the annoying piecewise-ness of the function down with simply 
returning `NaN` if `magnitude` ($r$) is zero and using a ternary operator to 
determine if the angle should be positive or negative. And [that][3] should be 
everything for the math utilities (for now)!
{:.content__p_noindent}

### VI-3. Testing
{:#vi-3}

Ok, so I thew together a little test for these utilities like so:

```javascript
export default class Game {
  // ...
  handleMouseDown(e) {
    // ...
    let vec = new Vector(mouse.position.x, mouse.position.y);
    console.log(vec.magnitude, (vec.direction / Math.PI));
    // ...
```

and the first issue that became immediately obvious was that I fucked up with 
the conditional in `get Vector#direction`: `magnitude = 0` should be `magnitude 
== 0`, but even after [fixing that][5], the angles are all... uhh. Pretty much 
always the same??? Oh! Fuck! Shit! I copied the formula down wrong the first 
time, the `return` should be:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
return (this.y < 0 ? -1 : 1) * Math.acos(this.x / magnitude);
```

Also, no reason to bother with the whole `/ Math.PI` part, I tested the values 
on `transform: rotate(...rad);` declarations in CSS and they perfectly reflect 
the direction of the vector in what is theoretically the first quadrant of the 
plane. This still needs to be tested on the other quadrants tho, since that 
tends to be when shit gets really weird with the reflected $y$-axis.

## VII. _Rendering Objects_
{:#vii}

Before I get to use any of these fun math utilities in the physics, I need 
objects to manipulate, so onto some actual rendering I go. First, I want a way 
to make sure that everything is being rendered in the correct position, based 
on the bounds of the game view. Easy function (based on a [StackOverflow
answer][6]):

```javascript
/** @type {number[]} */
get bounds() {
  const { top, left, height, width } = this.container.getBoundingClientRect();
  return { top, left, height, width };
}
```

### VII-1. Defining the Celestial
{:#vii-1}

More importantly, creating a `Celestial` class for game objects, what 
properties does it need? For physics: position, velocity, mass, and a hitbox; 
for rendering: position, size, and texture (things such as Elements will be set 
in the Renderer); then some metadata like name and "birthday." This class will 
be a very basic list of declarations, essentially:

```javascript
/** @module Celestial - Celestial game objects. */
export default class Celestial {
  constructor(options) {
    /*----- Metadata ---------------------------------------------------------*/
    this.name = options.name || "Unnamed Celestial";
    /** @var {number} birth Creation timestamp. */
    this.birth = +new Date();
    /*----- Physics ----------------------------------------------------------*/
    this.position = options.positions || new Point(0, 0);
    this.velocity = options.velocity || new Vector(0, 0);
    this.mass = options.mass || 0;
    /** @TODO Add HitBox class */
    this.hitBox = null;
    /*----- Rendering --------------------------------------------------------*/
    this.size = options.size || 0;
    this.texture = options.texture || null;
  }
}
```

At the moment, I'm probably not going to be using the `texture` property, I'll 
save that for when everything is more functional. It's just about the last day 
to work on this so I need to work on the minimum viable product (MVP), just 
making sure everything functions to the minimum requirements of the project 
before I do the Una thing and focus much more on the graphics than on the code. 
Not going to make a whole new font for this project, probably.
{:.content__p_noindent}

That in mind, having [added][7] this module, I'm just going to try to recreate 
the original before adding in the new stuff. First, need an array for objects 
in the level:

```javascript
/** @var {Celestial[]} scene Array of game objects in current scene. */
this.scene = [];
```

[Then][8] add in a couple instances in the main.js for now:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
let saturn = new Celestial({
    name: "Saturn",
    mass: 5.683e26,
    size: 102, // not to scale
  }),
  titan = new Celestial({
    name: "Titan",
    mass: 1.35e23,
    position: new Point(0, -389), // not to scale
    velocity: new Vector(15.26e3, 0),
    size: 18, // not to scale
  });
model.scene.push(saturn);
model.scene.push(titan);
```

### VII-2. `Renderer#render()`
{:#vii-2}

Since I haven't done any of the `position` or `size` scaling logic yet, these 
are just going to be literal pixel values for now so I can test out the 
rendering. So onto that rendering, first defining a `Renderer#render` function, 
default in the superclass to make sure there's always _something_ there:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
class Renderer {
  // ...
  /** Render the game scene. */
  render() {
    console.error("Renderer#render() has not been overwritten by subclass!");
  }
  // ...
```

Then in our `DOMRenderer`, we make sure that each object in the scene has an 
Element to render in an overwriting `DOMRenderer#render()` method:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
/** Render the game scene. */
render() {
  const scene = this.model.scene;
  scene.forEach(
    (obj) => obj.element || (obj.element = document.createElement("div"))
  );
}
```

A quick test shows that [this][9] works fine! So moving on to putting these in 
the scene by adding `&& this.container.append(obj.element)` into the loop. I 
don't like how these are just `<div>` Elements, though, so going to create a 
function to generate the appropriate Element instead:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
/**
 * Create a rendering Element for a Celestial and append it to the container.
 * @arg {Celestial} celestial
 * @returns {HTMLElement} The rendering Element for the Celestial.
 */
generateElement(celestial) {
  const element = document.createElement("celestial"),
    // Clean up the name for adding into a CSS class
    cleanName = celestial.name.replace(/\s+/g, "-").toLowerCase();
  element.classList.add(`gravity__celestial_${cleanName}`);
  celestial.element = element;
  this.container.append(celestial.element);
  return element;
}
```

[This][10] properly adds the Elements into the container,[^1] and returns them 
so I can use them inline like `const elem = obj.element ||
this.generateElement(obj);`, but I'm going to need to make sure all the 
elements are prepared with CSS before I can do anything further with them:[^2]

[^1]:   I have no idea how to document this in JSDoc, I would really like to 
        declare that `Celestial#element` is now `@type {HTMLElement}` but only 
        when `DOMRenderer` adds it!

[^2]:   I'm really tempted to write this out as actual SCSS so I can do some 
        nesting and imports, but I don't know if that's allowed in this project 
        or if I can do that on GitHub Pages without having a Jekyll Theme 
        set... I probably can, but I'll leave that for future work, I suppose.

```scss
gravity {
  height: 100%;
  left: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
gravity > celestial {
  position: absolute;
}
```

[Now][11] I can go in and apply all the position data to the Elements, which is 
pretty boring if I'm being honest! [But I did it!][12]:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
render() {
  const scene = this.model.scene,
    bounds = this.bounds,
    origin = {
      x: bounds.width / 2,
      y: bounds.height / 2,
    };
  scene.forEach(
    /** @arg obj {Celestial} */
    (obj) => {
      // Make sure each Celestial has an Element
      const elem = obj.element || this.generateElement(obj),
        // Avoid repeating elem.style a whole bunch.
        style = elem.style,
        offset = 0 - obj.size / 2;
      style.top = `${origin.y + obj.position.y + offset}px`;
      style.left = `${origin.x + obj.position.x + offset}px`;
      style.width = `${obj.size}px`;
      style.height = `${obj.size}px`;
    }
  );
}
```

### VII-3. Animation
{:#vii-3}

With the `Renderer#render()` method done, I need it to actually animate. Which 
is surprisingly simple, just loop it on each animation frame. I wish I had more 
to say about this, I guess I'm also adding in a boolean to tell it to stop if I 
want to stop it? Whatever, [just adding in][13] `Renderer#loop()`:

```javascript
class Renderer {
  constructor(model) {
    // ...
    /** @var {boolean} running Should the renderer continue running? */
    this.running = true;
  // ...
  /** Render on animationFrame */
  loop() {
    if (this.running) this.render();
    requestAnimationFrame(this.loop);
  }
```

A quick test showed some binding issues, so I guess I gotta do a little bit of 
manual binding:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
requestAnimationFrame(this.loop.bind(this));
```

[And now][14] it works, cool!

## VIII. _Physics_
{:#viii}

As long as I'm making loops, I'll throw in a little loop for the physics 
engine. Remember, physics gets weird if you calculate it based on the animation 
frames rather than a constant time, so this will be using
`window.setInterval()`:

```javascript
class Physics {
  constructor(model) {
    // ...
    /** @var {number} _intervalId Holds the ID of the loop interval. */
    this._intervalId = null;
  // ...
  /** @const {number} interval Interval time for physics loop. */
  static interval = 1e3 / 120;
  // ...
  /** Calculate physics on a set interval. */
  loop() {
    this._intervalId = window.setInterval(
      this.step.bind(this),
      Physics.interval
    );
  }
  /** Stop the physics engine loop. */
  stop() {
    window.clearInterval(this._intervalId);
  }
  /** Calculate the physics for objects in the scene and apply to model. */
  step() {
    // ...
```

### VIII-1. Update Positions
{:#viii-1}

Basic concept of this is to add the velocity vector multiplied by the time 
scale to the position vector of each object. I don't have a utility for adding 
vectors or for multiplying them by scalars. So going to [throw those][15] into 
the Utils.js module:

```javascript
class Point {
  // ...
  add(point) {
    this.x += point.x;
    this.y += point.y;
    return this;
  }
  // ...
class Vector extends Point {
  // ...
  scale(scalar) {
    this.magnitude = this.magnitude * scalar;
    return this;
  }
```

With those functions, I can [add in][16] the position updates pretty trivially:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
/** Update `Celestial#position`s based on `Celestial#velocity` */
updatePositions() {
  this.model.scene.forEach(
    /** @arg obj {Celestial} */
    (obj) => obj.position.add(obj.velocity.copy().scale(Physics.timeScale))
  );
}
```

Testing this would show a huge flaw: the velocities are way too fast! Because 
they're based on the actual physics and not the scale of the view, which hasn't 
been implemented yet, so I need to scale the position rendering based on the 
space scale... which was previously in `Physics` but is really only important 
for `Renderer`:

```javascript
export default class Renderer {
  constructor(model) {
    // ...
    /** @var {number} scale Space scale (meters per pixel). */
    this.scale = 0.3e7;
  // ...
```

Then to create a function for calculating the view position based on the model 
position, which I can do in the `Renderer` superclass rather than the 
`DOMRenderer` subclass, because all renderers would need this. First, I need to 
also [add][17] a scaling function for points, and, for convenience, modify the 
`Point#add()` function to accept a single argument and add that to both 
components.[^3]

[^3]:   I forgot `0` is falsey the first time I wrote this, so I just did `+= 
        addend.x || addend;` which would add and the Point to the `x` value if 
        `Point#x == 0`, so this needs to be a type check.

```javascript
class Point {
  // ...
  /**
   * Add another point to this point.
   * @arg {Point|number} addend A point to add to this point
   * @returns {Point} The updated point.
   */
  add(addend) {
    this.x += addend.x || addend;
    this.y += addend.y || addend;
    return this;
  }
  /**
   * Multiply point components by a scalar
   * @arg {number} scalar Multiplication scale
   * @returns {Point} The updated point.
   */
  scale(scalar) {
    this.x *= scalar;
    this.y *= scalar;
    return this;
  }
```

Now I can actually get the position with the function specifically for that in 
`Renderer` and use that function in my `DOMRenderer`:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
// In Renderer.js
class Renderer {
  // ...
  getPosition(celestial) {
    const bounds = this.bounds,
      // View origin point (0, 0)
      origin = new Point(
        bounds.width / 2,
        bounds.height / 2
      ),
      // View position from scaled Celestial position
      position = celestial.position.copy().scale(1 / this.scale),
      // View offset position from Celestial origin
      offset = celestial.size / 2;
    // Return offset view position
    return origin.add(position).subtract(offset);
  }
  // ...

// In DOMRenderer.js
class DOMRenderer extends Renderer {
  // ...
  render() {
    const scene = this.model.scene;
    scene.forEach(
      (obj) => {
        // ...
        const position = this.getPosition(obj);
        style.left = `${position.x}px`;
        style.top = `${position.y}px`;
        // ...
```

And, with [this added in and the test object scales updated][17], everything 
works as expected.
{:.content__p_noindent}

### VIII-2. Gravity
{:#viii-2}

Updating position based based on velocity is the most basic of basics when it 
comes to the physics, now I need to update the velocity based on acceleration. 
Technically, gravity is a force, so I _should_ update acceleration based on 
force, but I'm just going to calculate the acceleration from the gravity and 
apply that directly to the velocity. A fun shortcut. So how do we calculate 
gravitational acceleration? Well, [Newton's law of universal gravitation][18] 
is given as:

$$ F = G\cdot\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}, \tag6 $$

where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of two objects, $G$ is the gravitational 
constant (already defined as `Physics.G` in the module), and $r$ is the 
distance between the two "point-like masses." This "point-like masses" thing 
can basically be interpreted as the distance between their [centers of 
mass][19]; for convenience, I'm calling the `Celestial#position` the center of 
mass of the `Celestial` instance. Then, to get the acceleration applied by 
$m_2$ on $m_1$, we substitute [Newton's second law of motion][20], $F=ma$, in 
for $F$ and simplify:
{:.content__p_noindent}

$$
  \begin{align}
    m_1a &= G\cdot\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}, \tag{7a} \\
    a &= G\cdot\frac{m_1m_2}{m_1r^2}, \tag{7b} \\
    a &= G\cdot\frac{m_2}{r^2}. \tag{7c}
  \end{align}
$$

We can get this as a vector by simply multiplying it by the unit vector 
directed from $m_1$ to $m_2$, $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$:[^4]
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^4]:   Typically, one would define the _attraction force_ that a larger mass, 
        $M$, applies to a smaller mass, $m$, and so the force applied to $m$ 
        would be defined using the negation of the unit vector pointing from 
        $M$ to $m$: $-\hat{\mathbf{r}}$; however, since I'm just applying the 
        force as acceleration to the velocity of $m_1$, I'm defining the vector 
        $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ in the opposite direction.

$$ \mathbf{a} = \frac{Gm_2}{r^2}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{r}}. \tag8 \label8 $$

Now to actually implement this! First, I'm going to want a way to get the 
vector between two `Point`s ($P_1$ and $P_2$), which is just subtracting the 
components of $P_1$ from the components of $P_2$:

```javascript
/**
 * Get a copy of this Point as a Vector.
 * @returns {Vector} Copy of this Point as a Vector.
 */
copyAsVector() {
  return new Vector(this.x, this.y);
}
/**
 * Get a Vector between two points.
 * @param {Point} point 
 * @returns {Vector} A Vector between this Point and another Point.
 */
vectorTo(point) {
  return point.copyAsVector().subtract(this);
}
```

Having [added that][21], I can fairly easily use Eq. $\eqref{8}$ to get the acceleration between two instances of `Celestial`:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate gravitational acceleration between two Celestial instances
 * @param {Celestial} m_1 Celestial to apply acceleration to.
 * @param {Celestial} m_2 Celestial applying the acceleration.
 * @returns {Vector} Gravitational acceleration Vector.
 */
gravitate(m_1, m_2) {
  // Vector between m_1 and m_2
  const between = m_1.position.vectorTo(m_2.position),
    // Distance between m_1 and m_2
    r = between.magnitude;
  // Make `between` a unit vector
  between.magnitude = 1;
  return between.scale(Physics.G * m_2.mass / (r ** 2));
}
```

With the formula for gravitational acceleration [implemented like this][22], I 
just need to run it on each celestial for each other celestial, adding all the 
accelerations up, then updating the velocity based on that sum. I want to try 
doing this with [Array iterator functions][23] rather than `for` loops. Because 
this is a method running on each celestial, the outer "loop" will be a 
`.forEach()`, but the inner "loop" is a function, so it would be `.reduce()`:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
updateVelocities() {
  this.model.scene.forEach(
    /** @arg m_1 {Celestial} */
    (m_1) =>
      // Add to the velocity
      m_1.velocity.add(
        this.model.scene
          // Total acceleration
          .reduce(
            /**
             * @arg {Vector} acc Total acceleration (accumulator)
             * @arg {Celestial} m_2 Celestial applying acceleration
             */
            (acc, m_2) =>
              // Add gravitational acceleration if not same celestial
              m_1 === m_2 ? acc : acc.add(this.gravitate(m_1, m_2)),
            // Initialize an zero acceleration vector
            new Vector(0, 0)
          )
          // Velocity from acceleration
          .scale(Physics.timeScale)
      )
  );

This _looks_ fine, and it _almost_ works. But my test moon keeps getting away, like it's moving too fast? I don't think it is, though? Oh, it definitely is, it's set to a velocity of `15.26e3` when it should be `5.47e3`? Weird! Probably something to do with the scaling in the original JavaScript, but this works now so [that's it for the calculating gravity][24]!

### VIII-3. Collisions
{:#viii-3}

I never got around to this stuff in the original, but for game mechanics it's absolutely necessary to have a way to check collisions. Doing this for arbitrary shapes is fucking impossible, I think. There's probably a [way to do it][25], but for the moment, I'm just going to use circles as the hit boxes, so the math is like:

$$ (r_1+r_2)^2 \gt (x_1+x_2)^2 + (y_1+y_2)^2,\tag9 $$

where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the radii of the two circles and $(x_1,y_1)$ and 
$(x_2,y_2)$ are the coordinated of their centers respectively. However, since I have all this vector math handled already, I can just check this using a vector, $\mathbf{v}$, that represents the position of $(x_2,y_2)$ relative to $(x_1,y_1)$:
{:.content__p_noindent}

$$ r_1 + r_2 \gt \vert\mathbf{v}\rvert.\tag{10} $$

Implementation time! First, make sure that I'm future proofing this a bit by creating a `Celestial#hitBox` property that, at least for now, is simply a string describing the shape:

```javascript
class Celestial {
  constructor(options) {
    // ...
    /** @var {string} hitBox Shape of the hit box */
    this.hitBox = options.hitBox || "CIRCLE";
  // ...
```

Then make an Object for storing intersect check function. This is going to 
exist purely because I don't want to put in the effort of making a `HitBox` 
Class at the moment, essentially. This way the functions can be accessed as 
`Physics.INTERSECT_CHECKS[type][type]`,[^5] so I [implemented][26] it as such:
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^5]:   Note that this is when I decided that, since I'm calling them 
        "constants," I will adopt a constants naming convention for static 
        properties of classes. There was some refactoring involved.

```javascript
static INTERSECT_CHECKS = {
  CIRCLE: {
    CIRCLE:
      (a, b) => a.position.vectorTo(b.position).magnitude < a.size + b.size,
  },
};
checkIntersection(a, b) {
  return Physics.INTERSECT_CHECKS[a.hitBox][b.hitBox](a, b);
}
```

Okay, now time to do something about these collisions, for the time being, I'd 
like to log them in the `Celestial` object. Keeping a list of collisions like 
this is more general and allows me to add different means of using the 
information rather than simply writing a single handler right now. So, here's 
that:

```javascript
// In Celestial.js
class Celestial {
  constructor(options) {
    // ...
    /** @var {Object[]} collisions Log of collisions with other objects. */
    this.collisions = [];
    // ...

// In Physics.js
updateCollisions() {
  this.model.scene.forEach(
    /** @arg a {Celestial} */
    (a) =>
      this.model.scene.forEach(
        /** @arg b {Celestial} */
        (b) =>
          a !== b &&
          this.checkIntersection(a, b) &&
          a.collisions.push({
            time: +new Date(),
            who: b,
          })
      )
  );
}
```

But wait! Testing [this][27] by changing the color if the collision array is 
longer than zero shows absolutely no changes! Why? It's simple, the 
`Celestial#size` is in view scale, not model scale! What are the chances that 
the objects just so happen to be within such a tiny range on any given 
iteration anyway? Too low, also not what I want. So, all references to 
`Celestial#size` in a Renderer need to be divided by `Renderer#scale`, and the 
tests need to be scaled up.
{:.content__p_noindent}

[That][28] works better, but now they change before they actually hit! Because 
`Celestial#size` is a _diameter_ not a _radius_, duh! God, how did I fuck that 
up in the first place? Whatever, [fixed that][29]. And that's everything for the basic physics... next to make a game out of it...
