## III. _Structure_
{:#iii}

With the concept and design all decided on, it's time to set up the structure 
of the project. The assignment has some requirements regarding this, namely 
that the HTML, CSS, and JS all be in their own dedicated files and that we have 
a README to explain the project. That gives the basic structure like this:
{:.content__p_dropcap}

```
.
├── index.html
├── README.md
├── css
│   └── style.css
├── img
│   └── ...
├── js
│   └── main.js
└── .gitignore
```

However, there's some extra stuff I want to add, such as a "/docs" folder for 
any extra information, such as the [pseudocode][6]. I also want to try working 
with JavaScript modules, to make everything more, well, modular.
{:.content__p_noindent}

For now, having built out the basic structure, I'm just going to throw the tags 
into the `<head>` of "index.html":

```markup
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/main.css"/>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/main.js"></script>
```

### III-1. Modules
{:#iii-1}

The basics of [JavaScript modules][7] are pretty simple:

```javascript
// in modules/module.js
export {something, somethingElse};

// in main.js
import {something, somethingElse} from "./modules/module.js";
```

Which I'll set up for the three modules I intend to write: Physics.js, 
DOMRenderer.js, and Game.js. With the caveat that, for convenience, I will be 
using [defaults][8] and [classes][9] like so:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
// in modules/Game.js
export default class Game { //...

// in main.js
import { Game } from "./modules/Game.js";
```

Trying this out didn't work, I already know that modules only work on a sever, 
so I have one running locally to test this, but I was getting an error saying 
that `import` doesn't work outside of modules. This is slightly semantically 
confusing because you export from modules, you import into other scripts, but 
basically the `<script>` tag needs to be updated with the attribute 
`type="module"`.

Fixing that produces a new problem, because the export is a default, there is 
no export _named_ `Game` now! This is being caused by those curly brackets in 
the import, because that's for importing specific exports by name, but this is 
just grabbing the default export so it should be:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
import Game from "./modules/Game.js";
```

[And now][10] the modules are working as intended!
{:.content__p_noindent}

I want the code for this, and the comments, to be pretty legible and thorough, 
so I'm going to try to use the [JSDoc][11] standards for comments.[^2] So I'm 
reading the [docs for modules][12], which is kind of vague, but there _is_ a 
[more specific page][13] for ES 2015 Modules. Just declaring the module is 
pretty simple, but declaring the exports seems to be annoying, there's [a 
thread][14] posted on GitHub that basically says you just need to space it out 
with lines to fit in the declarations, like so:[^4]

[^2]:   This is also helpful with using VS Code, because it will read the JSDoc 
        comments and use them for tooltips when writing out function calls and 
        the like!
  
[^4]:   These were actually all originally block comments, but I updated them 
        to single lines in the code, so I updated them here to take up less 
        vertical space.

```javascript
/** @module modules/Game - Game logic module */
export default
  /** Class representing the game itself */
  class Game {
    /** Initialize a game */
    constructor(){
    // ...
```

This feels a bit clunky, but it works[^3] and is still at least legible without 
having to separate the `class` and `export` declarations, so I've [thrown that 
onto all the modules][15]!
{:.content__p_noindent}

[^3]:   Declaring modules like this with JSDoc in VS Code means that if you 
        call an export of a module that you haven't imported yet, it can 
        automatically fix the issue by adding the import to the script!

It's here that I'm also realizing that I really need to separate the model and 
controllers. Thinking back to the pseudocode, I had problems trying to figure 
out how to handle having the physics engine separate from the game logic, and I 
arbitrarily decided this should be done by passing the `Game` into the 
`Physics`, but now I think that having a new module for `GameData` would be 
best (it would also open up a clearer path to loading and saving games in the 
future). That should be everything for setting up the basic module structure, 
[done][16]!

Now I want to test this on the [public site][17], and I ran into a worse 
problem than expected! I messed up the JS and CSS links, since this is all 
published as a folder of [una-ada.github.io][18], I need to use relative paths. 
[Easy fix][19].

### III-2. Classes
{:#iii-2}

I'm not a huge fan of OOP in general, but this project just sort of feels like 
an OOP project, so everything is going to be done with classes, as should have 
been pretty clear from the previous section. What this really means here, is 
that rather than using `const` for constants in each module, I'll be using 
[`static`][20], which means they can be accessed as `Class.property` but not 
`instance.property`.

```javascript
class Physics {
  /** @constant {number} G - Gravitational constant */
  static G = 6.67e-11;
  // ...
```

Regarding the JSDoc comments here, for objects and some similar constructs, 
documenting variables just requires dot notation:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
  /** @constant {Object} scale - Conversion rates for physics equations */
  static scale = {
    /** @constant {number} scale.space - Meters per pixel */
    space: 0.30e7,
    /** @constant {number} scale.time - Seconds per animation frame */
    time: 0.50e3
  };
```

As far as what constants get copied, for now I've [just copied][21] the scales 
and `G` from the original script.
{:.content__p_noindent}

## IV. _Inputs_
{:#iv}

Ok, I need to start getting some sort of I/O done for this, basically just a 
proof of concept for user inputs. Per the pseudocode, the game state's 
properties regarding basic input are if the mouse is down, a cached position 
where the mouse was put down, and the current mouse position. This will require 
listeners for the `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and `mousemove` events to update. So 
that's what I'll do! First, the model:[^5]

[^5]:   I got so caught up in the documentation here that I somehow forgot to 
        use `isDown: false` rather than `isDown = false` initially, but that's 
        fixed now!

```javascript
class GameData {
  /** Create object to hold game states */
  constructor(){
    /** @var {Object} mouse - Data regarding the user's mouse */
    this.mouse = {
      /** @var {boolean} mouse.isDown - Is mouse currently down */
      isDown: false,
      /** @var {number[]} mouse.initialPosition - Position of mouse on down */
      initialPosition: [0, 0],
      /** @var {number[]} mouse.position - Current position of mouse */
      position: [0, 0]
    }
    //...
```

[Now][22], to add controllers for this. First, I'll need to make sure that the 
controller has access to the model, which is why it's being passed into it, but 
it also needs to save it. How do I document that `model` here should be an 
instance of `GameData`? The documentation for [`@type`][23] implies I just need 
to do `@var {GameData} model` but when I do tha&mdash; oh, I was just setting 
that on the `this.model` not on the parameter... wait, that also just says 
`model: any`, huh. Oh, right, modules! Ok:

```javascript
class Game {
  /**
   * Initialize a game controller.
   * @param {module:GameData.GameData} model
   */
  constructor(model){
    /** @var {module:GameData.GameData} model */
    this.model = model;
  }
  // ...
```

Well, it still shows as `any`, fuck. Oh, I've been over complicating things, I 
need to import the module for it to check out properly. Sure, this is 
technically just for documentation right now, but it could be very useful in 
the future:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
import GameData from "./GameData";
// ...
class Game {
  /**
   * Initialize a game controller.
   * @param {GameData} model - A game model instance.
   */
  constructor(model){
    /** @var {GameData} model - Reference to the game's model */
    this.model = model;
  }
  // ...
```

Finally, we can stop being on a detour and add some event listener functions, 
like `Game#handleMouseDown`. For now, I just want the basics, toggle 
`GameData#mouse.isDown` and save the position in
`GameData#mouse.initialPosition`. Even before that, let's make sure we can use 
this! Throw together the function like:

```javascript
class Game {
  // ...
  handleMouseDown(e){
    console.log("BOOP!", e);
  }
  // ...
```

Then, need to make the document listen for that. Adding a quick little 
`.addEventListener` in main.js:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
document.addEventListener("mousedown", game.handleMouseDown);
```

And now I'm getting a 404 in the console at `GameData:1`? Confusing. Oh, the 
import in Game.js is missing the ".js" part on `"./GameData.js"`! [Fixing 
that][24], and everything works now!
{:.content__p_noindent}

Before moving on, let's figure out how to document this. It might have 
something to do with the [`@event`][25] tag? There's [an answer][26] on 
StackOverflow about the `.addEventListener` call, not quite what I'm thinking 
of, plus it uses the `document` namespace and I don't think that's a thing (I 
did try it and it says `any`). The MDN page on [mousedown][27] actually helped 
less than that `console.log` above, which reminded me this is a `MouseEvent`, 
which VS Code shows as a real type, so we're cool.

Adding in the model updates, this now looks like:

```javascript
/**
 * Handle mouse down events
 * @param {MouseEvent} e - Mouse down event
 */
handleMouseDown(e){
  // Show mouse is down in model
  this.model.mouse.isDown = true;
  // Cache initial mouse position
  this.model.mouse.initialPosition = [e.pageX, e.pageY];
  // Save current mouse position
  this.model.mouse.position = [e.pageX, e.pageY];
}
```

Something I went and forgot about, what is `this` in an event listener? 
Certainly not what I want it to be! So maybe I'll bind it (uwu). Just update 
the listeners' callbacks to bind the controller:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
document.addEventListener("mousedown", game.handleMouseDown.bind(game));
```

And [there we go][28]! User inputs all handled and updating the model!
{:.content__p_noindent}

Of course, I don't particularly like the way I did all this. The positions are 
just arrays of two numbers, which is questionably. Temporarily, I'll make these 
Objects of the form `{x,y}`, and eventually will have classes for things like 
positions and vectors. Just [generally refactoring][29] at this point before 
moving on.

## V. _Render Setup_
{:#v}

Following along with the pseudocode, on of the earliest steps is to append a rendering container to the DOM, for the renderer to push all its renderings onto. While I did write down that this would all be handled in DOMRenderer.js, I want to avoid having to copy things if I write a different Renderer, so I'm going to make a generic Renderer class first:

```javascript
// In Renderer.js:
/** @module Renderer - Superclass for managing game view. */
export default class {
  // ...

// In DOMRenderer.js:
/** @module DOMRenderer - Manages the game view (DOM). */
export default class extends Renderer {
  /** Initialize a DOM-based renderer */
  constructor() {
    super();
    // ...
```

Now, I'd like to define the container element in the superclass, but for 
different rendering methods, a different element would be used (i.e. using  
canvas would require a `<canvas>` element). So this will be defined in the 
subclass instead:

```javascript
/** @var {HTMLElement} container - DOM Element holding all game views.*/
this.container = document.createElement("div");
```

The that can be appended to the DOM, so it can be used to actually render stuff later on:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
const model = new GameData(),
  view = new DOMRenderer(model),
  // ...
document.body.append(view.container);
```

That about [wraps it up][30] for the basic setup stuff, to be honest. From 
here, things are pretty straightforward, so future installations in the blog 
series will be more about general concepts or problems I come across.
