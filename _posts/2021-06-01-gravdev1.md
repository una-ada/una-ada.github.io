## Preface

Throughout my software engineering course, there are a few (specifically four) 
projects which I figure would be an excellent opportunity to start doing some 
personal writing again in the form of a development blog. I'll be trying to keep 
up with this as I complete the project (due June 4, 2021). In the interest of 
keeping relevant articles on blogs on relevant domains, writing this blog will 
necessitate some updates to [una-ada.github.io](https://una-ada.github.io), 
including but not limited to finally finishing the layouts, rewriting the 
index, and adding a new (custom) font for code blocks. If I happen to write 
anything about that particular process (which I definitely will for at least 
the font design), those blogs will not be included in the sequence of these, 
tho I may include links to them if I find that to be of interest at the time.

So, about this project then. This is the first of out projects, pairing up 
with the introductory module on HTML, CSS, and JS. As this is only the 
introductory section, we're not using any frameworks or libraries, simply 
vanilla JS with rendering handled through DOM manipulation, which is an 
interesting limitation as the goal here is to create a browser-based game. We 
only have a week and some change to complete it, so this limitation isn't too 
absurd as we're likely not going to be making anything that would absolutely 
require a different rendering method (e.g. canvas). That's really all there is 
to it: make a browser game; obviously there's also the additional requirements 
to show specific competencies along the lines of documentation, legible code, 
codebase consistency, published via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), 
etc., but those aren't particular to the goal here.

## I. _Concept_
{:#i}

The first step in any project is simply deciding what to do. This step is sort
of skipped in most personal projects, one acts on the ideas they have and a
project is formed, but with an assignment there is a certain necessity of
putting some thought into this. Of course, I decided to not think of it much and
just picked from my nearly infinite stack of unfinished projects, namely those
which require a complete rewrite and could meet the given requirements. So, I'll
go over what that project was, what it should be, and how I'm planning to get
there in this section.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

### I-1. Background
{:#i-1} 

Let's take a brief look back to some time around 2013 for context. As a high 
school student who had stumbled into programming as a hobby, I wanted to take 
on some sort of project to expand my knowledge, particularly in the direction 
of web services, and decided during some typical sleepless night to follow 
along with a social network tutorial in PHP (in a LAMP stack, but I was on 
windows so it was really a WAMP stack in the end). This little project would 
continue on under the name ["Graphene"](https://github.com/peheneco/Graphene) 
in reference to its intended connectivity and because I just thought it was 
neat. A little while passed (around 2014 now) and I wanted to start having this
project publicly  available to share with people! The name itself isn't super
common, but it is a real word and one that refers to a product that can be a
pretty big deal, so there was no way in hell I'd be able to afford a
"graphene.*" domain with my dozens of dollars. As a compromise, a little 
loophole was pulled and the end domain was "gra.phene.co" (this is definitely 
down nowadays, by the way). With the project on a subdomain like this, the 
opportunity to create a developer group (not quite a legal company, but it 
could've been some day) with a pretty much already decided name appeared.

![Original Phene Logo](/assets/img/gdl/phene-original.png)<br/>
**FIGURE 1.** Screenshot of the original Phene logo design in a post on Graphene
(March 27, 2015). As far as I know, this is the only copy I have right now.
{:.pullquote .pullquote_image}

This group was clearly to be named [Phene Co.](https://github.com/pheneco/) and
consisted of myself and _sometimes_ one of my friends from back in middle school
(he has a programming job and everything now, congrats to him). Being very
design-oriented myself, I just had to come up with some branding for this! I
started with the idea of writing the name out in cyrillic (фен), combining
the letters, and ending up with **FIGURE 1.** Down the line this was simplified
to be basically just a rounded letter phi ("ф"), but I wanted something more 
alive. Then came the idea that the letter could be seen as a ringed planet from 
the side of its rings, so I created an alternative version from another 
perspective. One object from two angles is just ripe for animation, right? So 
that's what I did! See **FIGURE 2.**


![Animated Phene Logo](/assets/img/gdl/phi-to-planet.gif)<br/>
**FIGURE 2.** Redesigned Phene logo with animation (30 frames).
{:.pullquote .pullquote_image .pullquote_left}

This design gave me a very fun idea for how the website should look: the planet
would sit in the middle being orbited by little moons, and when you scrolled
down to the next section then planet would move over to the side while switching
to the phi and the moons would all fall into place to act as section anchors. I
tried to make that and I found out it's *really hard* to get objects to animate
the way you want from arbitrary positions to set positions, especially when they
were already animated... so there was but one solution to this: actually write
the animation as a gravity simulation. Somehow I managed to make that (the logo
animation notwithstanding) and it's still available for viewing at
[pheneco.github.io](https://pheneco.github.io/).
{:.content__p_noindent}

There's no way that was enough though, right? I made this cute little gravity
simulator and it was all for one "simple" animation? I couldn't have that, I
wanted to play with it more! And that's just what I did. I moved the animation 
over to a new document and started adding user inputs: clicking would create a 
new moon, holding would increase its mass, dragging would set the velocity, and 
when you let go it would set off in the direction you indicate. I also did a 
fair bit of extra design: little tooltips to show mass and velocity, a sun for 
the planet to orbit, settings to change to dark mode or follow different 
objects, it became quite fun and you can check that version out 
[here](https://una-ada.github.io/js/phys/gravity). I'm actually quite fond of 
how the UI turned out, it looks clean and, as far as I can tell, is fairly 
intuitive:
{:.content__p_noindent}

dragging the mouse to set velocity on a new moon.
{:.content__p_noindent}

### I-2. Issues
{:#i-2}

This is cool, but far from perfect. Let's go over a few reasons why, so you can 
stop admiring it so much.

First off, there's no collision detection, which might sound like a feature 
request rather than a bug if it weren't for physics. See, without collisions, 
the center of mass of two objects can get really close, and with inverse 
squares this means the gravitational force will be raising exponentially, thus 
the acceleration and the velocity will get pretty high. Basically, things get 
close then fly off screen because that makes them go super fast.
{:.content__p_noindent}

Next, right click. The event handlers do not know what to do about right 
clicking. Using right click to make moons and try adding velocity will make the 
game logic forget which moon is being updated and which isn't, only barely 
managing due to the overwriting of variables. After only a few times of doing 
this, it will completely break, and you can just use the left mouse to draw 
dots on the screen. This is a _bug_ not a _feature_; I think it's funny, but I 
need to fix it.

Then: the settings. Why the fuck did I think scrolling on the fields was a good 
way to do settings options? Was it to avoid having to complicate the event 
handlers? Because I sure seem to have avoided putting in any effort for those 
in general (see previous item).

Overall, there's a lot of minor bugs, a few very noticeable ones, and the code 
for it all is horrendous. Actually, let's talk more about the code...

### I-3. Code Review
{:#i-3}

Alright, I'm going to go through this step-by-step to discuss the functioning 
as well as the formatting and such. The basics is that [the code][1] is all in 
a single file, meant to be portable. Well, except for the fonts which use 
[Google Fonts][2] to load in [Droid Serif][3] (no longer free), [Roboto][4], 
and [Material Icons][5]:

```markup
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=
    Droid+Serif:400i,700i|
    Roboto:400,900|
    Material+Icons"
  rel="stylesheet"
>
```

... but the images are all loaded in with JavaScript as Base64 strings or SVGs 
(the blocks are all pretty long, like 11 lines, so I'm cutting them short):
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
window.gridImg  = "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGQAAA"
                + "BkCAIAAAD/gAIDAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQ"
                + // ...
window.gridDark = "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGQAAA"
                + "BkCAIAAAD/gAIDAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAlwSFlzAAAOwg"
                + // ...
window.defHBox  = '<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0'
                + ' 2 2"><circle cx="1" cy="1" r="1"/></svg>';
```

Then all the CSS is just in the `<head>` as well, mostly just basic positioning 
(put things in their corners) and font styles, but the interesting stuff here 
is the planets and moons:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```scss
#nav {position:fixed;z-index:100;}
  #planet {position:absolute;width:102px;height:102px;}
  #planet .info {display:none;}
  #planet:hover .info	{display:block;}
  .moon {position:absolute;width:18px;height:18px;}
  .moon .shell {border:9px solid #333;border-radius:50%;
      height:0px;position:absolute;width:0px;}
  .moon.current .shell{height:0px;margin:5px;width:0px;}
  .info {color:#333;height:20px;left:12px;
  line-height:20px;position:absolute;top:-10px;
  width:150px;}
```

That's right! It's all minified, with just a little bit of formatting to match 
the DOM structure a little bit! For the new version, the CSS will all be in its 
own file, and each declaration on its own line. In the past, I didn't have good 
experience with IDEs that had decent folding, or would just need to see the 
whole stylesheet at once, or something like that, so I had a tendency to write 
all my CSS like this and avoid vertical spacing.
{:.content__p_noindent}

#### I-3.1 Markup
{:#i-3-1}

Moving on, the markup is all pretty straightforward, there's a `<div>` with the 
id `#nav`, which contains all the game objects. This naming comes from the 
history of the project, where this was all meant to be a navigation menu (see 
[Section I-1](#i-1)). The predefined objects here are Saturn, Titan, and the 
Sun, the second of which is probably the best to show the basic structure:

```markup
<div
    style="left:calc(50vw - 9px);top:calc(50vh + 398px);
        width:18px;height:18px;"
    class="moon"
    direction="0"
    mass="1.35e23"
    name="titan"
    velocity="15.26e3"
>
    <div class="shell" style="width:0px;height:0px;">
        <div class="info" style="top:-10px;left:12px;"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

You'll see a lot of attributes here, which are used in the game logic, implying 
(correctly) that the game data was mostly stored in the DOM. Funny. Saturn, on 
the other hand, does not have this `div.shell` child, instead being styled with 
an embedded SVG; it also has a defined `hitbox` element in it, which was 
intended to be used when I added collision detection, but that never happened.
{:.content__p_noindent}

And finally, there's the settings and such, mostly `div`s which are positioned 
in the corners, but the structure of the settings menu is notable:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```markup
<table>
    scroll to adjust:
    <tr id="setting-fllw">
        <td>follow</td>
        <td>
            <span class="setting">
                <span class="unit">saturn</span>
            </span>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr id="setting-grid">
        <!-- table row... -->
    <tr id="setting-theme">
        <!-- table row... -->
    <tr id="setting-wmark">
        <!-- table row... -->
</table>
```

Why is the text node a direct child of the `<table>`? Nobody knows!
{:.content__p_noindent}

#### I-3.2 Game Loop
{:#i-3-2}

The JavaScript all starts with this little thing:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('load',E_.start(()=>{
  window.scale = E_.phys.scale;
  for(let e of nav.children) E_.phys.register(e);
}));
```

which calls `E_.start`, passing in a callback which just shallow copies the 
`E_.phys.scale` into the `window` namespace, for scope reasons, I guess, then 
registers all children of the `div#nav` element. That initializing function is 
the interesting part here, annotated for convenience:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
start	(startup=()=>{},callback=()=>{}){
  startup(); // call startup function
  // define a steps array for the game
  E_.steps = [
    E_.render
  ];
  // define a steps array for physics
  E_.phys.steps = [
    E_.phys.gravity,
    E_.phys.move
  ];
  E_.settings(); // initialize settings
  E_.phys.loop(); // start physics loop
  E_.loop(); // start game loop
  callback(); // callback
},
```

These loop functions are pretty nice:
{:.content__p_noindent}

```javascript
running	: !0,
loop	(){
  // loop on animation frame if running
  if(E_.running)
    requestAnimationFrame(E_.loop);
  // generator function to step through E_.steps
  E_.step = (function*(s){
    for(let i of s)
      yield i;
  })(E_.steps);
  // run next step
  E_.step.next().value();
},
```

Could use some fixing up, but hey it works and is quite scalable. This time 
around, though, I'm going to experiment with different ways to do this other 
than just using a generator function.
{:.content__p_noindent}

That's about it for the interesting code, to be honest, the rest is pretty much 
canonical. Render things where they should be, move things when they need to, 
etc. I don't really care to keep going on about this, but check this shit out, 
lmao:

```javascript
numAbbr(n,f=3,l=false){
  if(l&&(""+~~n).length<f+4) return ~~n;
  var tm;
  return (tm = ""+~~((10**f)*(n/10**~~Math.log10(n)))/(10**f))
    + (""+E_.display.zeroStr(f+2-tm.length))
    + "e" + ~~Math.log10(n);
},
```

## II. _Planning_
{:#ii}

What needs to happen then? First, features: this isn't a game, it's a toy, and 
it needs to become a game. I've considered this before, but it's what ought to 
happen now to meet the requirements for the assignment. Also, collisions, for 
any sort of game mechanic, I'm going to need to be able to check hitbox 
intersections.
{:.content__p_dropcap}

Beyond that, the code needs to be completely rewritten. I don't like what it is 
now, it's hard to expand upon, it needs a rewrite. Keeping future work in mind, 
I'm going to do this with some modularity, e.g. using modules. Now then, onto 
the specifics...
{:.content__p_noindent}

### II-1. Wireframe
{:#ii-1}

This part was pretty basic, it's mostly just the original's layout with the 
settings moved to what will hopefully be a dialog, a link to the repo, a 
"lives" counter, and a game message display. The gameplay elements are also 
new, drawing areas for both the starting region where the player will create 
the moon to put into play and a target region where they should be aiming.

This is pretty straightforward, since I'm just applying the basic concepts of 
what makes a game: rules to restrict the player (starting area, lives) and 
goals (target area).
{:.content__p_noindent}

### II-2. Pseudocode
{:#ii-2}

If I had actually written this blog as I was working on these things, this 
would have been a lot more in depth, as the pseudocode for the new version is 
basically just the outline of the old version reorganized into modules. I am, 
however, too lazy at this point to write a more complete code review and 
explain how each function is being moved, so just take the pseudocode and run, 
I say:

#### II-2.1 main.js
{:#ii-2-1}

- Import modules
  - physics engine (Physics.js) &rarr; `phys`
  - renderer (DOMRenderer.js) &rarr; `renderer`
  - game logic (Game.js) &rarr; `game`
- Define constants (instances of modules)
- Cache DOM elements
- Initialize game
  - Pass elements into `init()`
  - Initialize `renderer`
  - Append `renderer.container` to DOM
  - Initialize `game` (pass in `renderer`)
  - Initialize `phys` (pass in `game`)
  - Add event listeners to `renderer.container` to update `game` state <br/>
    *These should probably be functions in the `game` module.*
    - `mousedown` &rarr;
      - `true` on mouse being down
      - cache mouse position as `Object`
    - `mousemove` &rarr; current mouse position as `Object`
    - `mouseup` &rarr; `false` on mouse being down
  - Start `phys` loop
  - Start `game` loop <br/>
    *These need to be separate because physics simulation is time based but the
    renderer is based on animation frames.*

#### II-2.2 DOMRenderer.js
{:#ii-2-2}

- Define `container` `Element`
- For each type of object in the game
  - Define initializing `function` <br/>
    *Take in the attributes the item has according to the model and create an
    `Element` matching that description. Append this `Element` to the
    `container`*
  - Define setter `function` <br/>
    *A `function` which will update the DOM `Element` (view) to match the model
    in `game`.*
- Initialize UI
  - Create `Element` for ...
    - settings menu
    - settings button
    - repo/docs link
    - velocity display
    - "health" display <br/>
      *I'm calling this "health" as a convenient analogy, it will really be a
      number of attempts remaining to get the "moon" into the target area.*
    - game messages display
  - ... and append to `container`
- Define renderer update `function` <br/>
  *This could possibly be completely removed. I'm not entirely certain at this 
  point, but it might be possible to have the renderer define something like a 
  setter on the game objects... not sure how I feel about the idea yet, since
  the physics engine will likely be the one updating a lot of the model rather
  than the `game`.*
  - Update displays according to `game` state:
    - velocity
    - "health"
    - game messages
  - Update game objects
    - remove `Element` if absent from `game` state
    - update attributes to match state
    - add `Element` if newly added to `game` state <br/>
      *Not entirely sure how this will go at the moment, either caching render
      states or setting a flag on the renderer's `Object` for the game object to
      show that it has not been rendered yet.*

#### II-2.3 Game.js
{:#ii-2-3}

- Define constants
  - Same position threshold for mouse positions
  - Mass increment rate
- Define state
  - `Object` to hold game objects <br/>
    *Game objects will have a class, with extensions for each sort of object,
    and each will have mass, velocity, position, hitbox, and an array of
    collisions.*
  - Current level
  - "Health"
  - Is mouse down?
  - Cached mouse position on `mousedown`
  - Current mouse position
  - Is creating "moon"?
- Define initialization `function`
  - Save `renderer` reference
  - Re(set) current level
  - Import level information <br/>
    *This should be some sort of data file describing how each level works, the 
    initial state of any obstacles, the starting area, the target area, the
    allowed number of attempts, if custom mass is allowed, and the game
    message.*
  - *Not sure what else this needs to do since most variables would be managed
    by level loading. Perhaps load some sort of splash screen? Load settings
    from a cookie?*
- Define level loading `function`
  - Remove all game objects
  - Set state according to level data
- Define game loop `function`
  - If mouse is down
    - If not creating moon and health isn't zero
      - Is creating moon `true`
      - Create instance for new moon
        - At cached mouse position
        - No physics
    - If creating moon
      - If current position within threshold of cached position and level allows   
        custom mass
        - Increment mass of moon by mass increment rate
      - Else calculate velocity from change in mouse position between cached and
        current <br/>
        *This will be a `phys` function, for scaling reasons.*
  - Else (mouse not down) if creating moon
    - Is creating moon `false`
    - Turn on physics for moon
    - Remove one from "health"
  - Check for game object collisions
    - If moon collides with object
      - Remove moon
      - If health is zero and no other moons LOSS CONDITION
    - If moon collides with target area
      - WIN CONDITION
    - *Other conditions should probably be handled somehow!*
  - Call `renderer.update`
  - Call back to loop on next animation frame
- *Defining game object classes should probably be deferred to separate files,
  see previous notes on what those might look like.*

#### II-2.4 Physics.js
{:#ii-2-4}

- Define constants
  - Gravitational constant
  - Position scale (pixels to meters)
  - Velocity scale (pixels/second to meters/second)
  - Time scale
- Define gravitation `function`
  - For each game object (1)
    - For each other game object (2) add calculated gravitational acceleration 
      multiplied by the time scale to the object (1)'s velocity
- Define move objects `function`
  - For each game object update position based on velocity and time scale
- Define check collisions `function`
  - For each game object (1)
    - For each other game object (2)
      - If hitboxes intersect, log other object (2) to object (1)'s collisions
- Define physics loop
  - Call gravity
  - Call move
  - Call check collisions
  - Call back to loop after timeout <br/>
    *Timeout will probably be set to 1/60th second, this is probably pretty
    similar to the animation framerate but if this is dependent on that the time 
    scales get weird for some reason (I've tested it before).*
